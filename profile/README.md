## ‚ò¢Ô∏è Welcome to Binary-Offensive.com ‚ò¢Ô∏è

This is an organization profile where I share my private Offensive Security Tooling (OST) available to sponsors, who consider my work valuable and show their support. 

My name is Mariusz Banach and I'm a Red Team operator specialized in malware/offensive tooling development & adversary simulation. I code a lot up until late morning hours with incentive to enhance red team tooling, attacker TTPs and improve world's cyber-security resilience against APT groups. 

IF you wish to access OST shared here, please [consider buying me a coffee](https://github.com/sponsors/mgeeky) _(or better a beer)_ as a way of saying thank you! üí™
